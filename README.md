## What comes next? and other issues...

Moving forward, I'd like to have a more in depth exploration of Node. This was a great first project to code, as it I got familiarized with Inquirer, one of the most used packages out there.

As always, I'm looking to make my code more efficient by consolidating where I can. Overall, I feel I've improved in this area, but there is always room to grow.

One of the bugs I'd like to fix is a relatively small one, but still a bug nonetheless. In the raw markdown file, when the user does not select a license, a gap is shown in the table of contents. I was unable to figure out how to make this disappear.

## Installation

Requires Node.js.

Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

## Usage

1. Clone repository from GitHub (See GitHub Repo link at the top of this README)

2. Open your code editor's integrated terminal or use the system terminal/bash

3. In the command line, enter "node index.js"

4. Answer the questions as they appear

5. View your read me in the file stack or code editor!
